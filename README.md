# Namara
Namara is an lightweight browser programmed in Java 8.

If there are issues about JavaFX versions or crashing
please tell me.

This Project is build of JavaFX 8 it should load many websites but it has limitations of JavaFX 8 because it has browser Technologics of 2016.

But its perfect for old Windows versions like Windows XP or Windows Vista.
On Windows XP its probablly not useable because it cannot run Java 8 normally or should it? I dont know.

System Requirments:

You need Windows XP or higher

Java 8 with JavaFX 8 (when not preinstalled with Java)

768MB of RAM or more.

And you can run it of course on another OSes like MacOS or Linux.
